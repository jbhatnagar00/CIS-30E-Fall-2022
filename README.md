# CIS-30E-Fall-2022

My project was solving a problem that a patient may face in scheduling and keeping track of their appointment, mainly getting lost in the process of choosing doctors and times. The objective and purpose of the program is streamlining and simplifying the process of creating an appointment with very clear instructions and options for each step. It removes any confusion someone may deal with as a result, avoiding possible time conflicts as one example. The solution/algorithm (goes hand-in-hand) involves a list of doctors being shown after the patient enters their desired date and chooses between scheduling an appointment with a doctor directly, or scheduling one by selecting a doctor based on their specialty first. Then, the doctors available have their schedules shown with what times they are available and what times are unavailable. This makes it extremely easy for the patient to find the right appointment time based on their personal schedule. Once the patient selects the time slot they want to book, a confirmation message is shown. 
The algorithm uses concurrency as another tool to generate and print the list of appointment times at the same time. Modules implemented in the program were random, datetime, and threading. Code from data.py is brought as well. Random randomly generates the appointment schedule (available/occupied times), datetime is used for scheduling and checking doctor availability, threading is used for the main thread, and data.py brings in a list of doctors (dictionary), list of patients (dictionary), and a list of appointments (dictionary). 
Limitations of the program include times being in military time instead of standard time, and the doctor section is not fully fleshed out to show the appointment for a certain doctor after scheduling one as a patient (I wanted to work on this but unfortunately time was cut short due to UCI’s hard deadline and needing my grade earlier to send my transcript). These limitations can be improved by making the schedule show standard time and giving doctors more utility by allowing them to see more information on what is happening on the patient scheduling side. 



Example of program simulation/sequence
