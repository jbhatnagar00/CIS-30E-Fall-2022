# CIS-30E-Fall-2022

My project was solving a problem that a patient may face in scheduling and keeping track of their appointment, mainly getting lost in the process of choosing doctors and times. The objective and purpose of the program is streamlining and simplifying the process of creating an appointment with very clear instructions and options for each step. It removes any confusion someone may deal with as a result, avoiding possible time conflicts as one example. See documentation for further details.
